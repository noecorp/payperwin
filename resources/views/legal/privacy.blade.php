			<h2>Basic Principles</h2>
			<p>It is PayPerWin's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. At its core, our privacy policy boils down to the following:</p> 
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>We don't ask you for personally-identifiable information unless we truly need it.</li>
					<li>We don't share your personally-identifiable information with except in cases of legal compliance, for our own product development, or to protect our rights.</li>
					<li>We don't store personally-identifiable information on our servers unless required for continued service operations.</li>
					<li>We try to limit how much user data is made available to external services, such as analytics and support providers.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data <a href="mailto:gg@payperwin.gg" class="support-link">just let us know.</a></p>

			<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
			<p>Like most website operators, we collects non-personally-identifiable information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PayPerWin's purpose in collecting non-personally-identifiable information is to better understand how PayPerWin's visitors use its website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifiable information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>PayPerWin also collects potentially personally-identifiable information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and emails of users. We only disclose this information under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifiable information as described below.</p>

			<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifiable Information</h2>
			<p>Certain visitors to PayPerWin's website choose to interact with the website in ways that require us to gather personally-identifiable information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide a username and email address. Those who make purchases may be asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, PayPerWin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with the website. We do not disclose personally-identifiable information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifiable information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

			<p>If you log into the Site using your account login information from certain third party sites, e.g. Twitch, we may receive information about you from the third party site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of such third party site. We may add this information to the information we have already collected.</p>

			<p>Do Not Track Signals: Your web browser may enable you to indicate your preference as to whether you wish to allow websites to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. At this time our site does not respond to the preferences you may have set in your web browser regarding the collection of such personal information, and our site may continue to collect personal information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
			<p>PayPerWin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, we may monitor the most popular pages. PayPerWin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, we do not disclose personally-identifiable information other than as described below.</p>

			<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifiable Information</h2>
			<p>We disclose potentially personally-identifiable and personally-identifiable information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PayPerWin's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifiable and personally-identifiable information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifiable and personally-identifiable information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, that of third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user, PayPerWin may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with our service. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. PayPerWin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifiable and personally-identifiable information.</p>

			<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations. You may also send requests about your contact preferences and changes to your information by emailing <a href="mailto:gg@payperwin.gg" class="support-link">gg@payperwin.gg</a>.</p>

			<h2>Cookies</h2>
			<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. PayPerWin uses cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of the website, and their website access preferences. PayPerWin visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the website, with the drawback that certain features of the website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

			<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
			<p>If PayPerWin, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that PayPerWin goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of PayPerWin may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

			<h2>Ads</h2>
			<p>Ads appearing on the website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by PayPerWin and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

			<h2>External Services</h2>
			<p>The PayPerWin website may contain links to other websites that are not under our direct control. These websites may have their own policies regarding privacy. We have no control of or responsibility for linked websites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. You access such linked Services at your own risk. These websites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. You should check the privacy policies, if any, of those individual websites to see how the operators of those third-party websites will utilize your personal information.</p>

			<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
			<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, PayPerWIn may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in PayPerWin's sole discretion. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy Policy. If you have a PayPerWin account, you should also check your website dashboard and email inbox for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
