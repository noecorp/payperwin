## An Assembly Project

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. Find out more at [https://assembly.com/payperwin](https://assembly.com/payperwin).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
