## Game result monetisation for eSports streamers.

- Initially launching for League of Legends streamers, using Riot's Public Game API.
- eSports Streamers get paid for in-game results such as wins, kills, assists, and KDA (Kill-Death-Assist ratio). This supplements their salary, streaming, donations, and other income by allowing their fans to reward entertaining in-game action. Sort of loosely conditional donations, or micro-sponsorships if you will.
- Streamers register on the platform and link to their PayPerWin profile page on their Twitch profile page.
- Fans/viewers register on the platform, top up their account, and pledge values to their favourite streamer's in-game results.
- Pledges can be customised with limits on number of games (next 5 wins) and number of kills/assists/KDA (reward max 8 kills per game).
- Every registered streamer's winning ranked game is tracked via Riot's API and pledges are automatically distributed by the system.
- Streamers get paid monthly based on the previous month's accrued pledges, minus the platform's commission.
- Game types limited to Ranked (Normal games are off-limits to API atm) WINS. Restricting to WINS prevents streamers from ruining teammate's games by focusing on monetised kills over winning.
- There should be logical built-in limits on weekly/monthly total pledge amounts per user and maximum rewardable kills/assists/KDA per game.
